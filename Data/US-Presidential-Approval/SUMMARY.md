## The Big Picture

Presidential approval ratings are the primary measure of public confidence in the president. [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx) has tracked this since 1937 using a consistent question: *"Do you approve or disapprove of the way [President] is handling his job as President?"*

This dataset contains:
- **12,479 individual polls** spanning 87+ years
- **14 presidents** from FDR through Trump (second term)
- **Multiple pollsters** for cross-validation

---

## Why This Number Matters

Presidential approval is a leading indicator for:

- **Legislative success**: High approval = political capital for agenda
- **Reelection chances**: Presidents above 50% almost always win reelection
- **Market confidence**: Investor and business sentiment
- **Governing ability**: Approval affects congressional cooperation
- **Historical legacy**: Approval shapes how presidents are remembered

## How to Interpret Polling Data

### Net Approval
```
Net Approval = Approval % - Disapproval %
```
- **Positive** (+5 or higher): More approve than disapprove
- **Around zero**: Evenly divided
- **Negative** (-5 or lower): More disapprove than approve

### Polling Variation
Different pollsters show 3-7 point variation due to:
- Sample type (adults vs. registered vs. likely voters)
- Methodology (phone vs. online)
- Question wording and order
- Timing within news cycle

**Best practice**: Use averages from aggregators like [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html) or [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/) (when available).
