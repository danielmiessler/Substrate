**Research Study**
**Date:** November 9-10, 2025
**Researcher:** Daniel Miessler
**Research Design:** Multi-agent parallel investigation (9 specialized agents)

---

## Research Question

What percentage of data generated globally is actually viewed, analyzed, or acted upon by humans or AI systems?

---

## Methodology

### Research Design

Multi-agent parallel research utilizing 9 specialized AI research agents distributed across 4 platforms (Perplexity AI, Claude, Gemini, WebSearch) to gather and cross-validate data from industry reports, platform statistics, and academic studies.

**Research Duration:** 6 hours across 2 sessions
**Source Coverage:** 150+ authoritative sources (2024-2025 data)

### Agent Assignments

**Phase 1: Enterprise Data (6 agents)**
1. Enterprise dark data statistics (Veritas, IDC, Gartner)
2. Communication engagement rates (email, Slack, Teams)
3. Document access patterns (Google Docs, Word, Confluence)
4. Code review coverage (GitHub, GitLab)
5. Security log analysis rates (SIEM, observability tools)
6. AI automation penetration in enterprises

**Phase 2: Global Data Breakdown (3 agents)**
7. Global data generation by type (149 ZB total)
8. Video content utilization (streaming, surveillance, user-generated)
9. IoT sensor data utilization (21.1B devices)

### Quality Assurance

- Minimum 3 sources per major claim
- Cross-platform verification
- Confidence levels assigned to all findings
- Contradictory evidence documented

---

## Primary Finding

**Of 149 zettabytes generated globally in 2024:**
- **12-15% examined** by humans or AI (~20 ZB)
- **85-88% never examined** by anyone (~129 ZB)

**Breakdown by examiner:**
- Humans only: 8-10%
- AI only: 5-10%
- Both human and AI: ~3%
- Neither: 85-88%

## Data Generation and Utilization by Category

| Data Type | Annual Volume | % of Total | Utilization Rate | Source Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Streaming Video** | 45 ZB | 30% | 60-70% watched | High (90%+) |
| **Surveillance Video** | 33 ZB | 22% | 1-5% watched | High (90%+) |
| **IoT Sensor Data** | 34 ZB | 23% | <5% analyzed | High (90%+) |
| **Machine Logs** | 21 ZB | 14% | 10-20% examined | Medium (70-90%) |
| **Enterprise Data** | 13 ZB | 9% | 25-30% examined | High (90%+) |
| **Social Media** | 3 ZB | 2% | 30-40% viewed | Medium (70-90%) |

**Total Global Generation:** 149 ZB/year (IDC Data Age 2025)

## Detailed Findings by Category

### Surveillance Video (22% of global data)

**Generation:**
- 1+ billion cameras worldwide
- 5.5 million TB/day of footage
- 33 zettabytes/year

**Utilization:**
- 95-99% never watched
- Footage stored for compliance/legal requirements
- Only reviewed if incident reported

**Sources:** Grand View Research 2024, security industry studies
**Confidence:** High (90%+)

---

### IoT Sensor Data (23% of global data)

**Generation:**
- 21.1 billion connected devices
- 79.4 zettabytes/year (projected 2025)
- Industrial sensors, smart homes, wearables, vehicles

**Utilization:**
- 90% becomes "dark data" (collected but never analyzed)
- 30-50% filtered at edge before storage
- <5% of stored data analyzed
- 99% lost before reaching operational decisions (industrial settings)

**Sources:** IoT Analytics 2024, McKinsey Digital
**Confidence:** High (90%+)

---

### Machine Logs & Telemetry (14% of global data)

**Generation:**
- Server logs, application logs, network telemetry
- Cloud infrastructure monitoring
- 21 zettabytes/year

**Utilization:**
- 80-90% never examined
- >90% of observability data never read
- Stored for compliance and debugging, not active analysis
- 44% of security alerts uninvestigated

**Sources:** Coralogix 2024, SANS SOC Survey 2024
**Confidence:** Medium-High (80%+)

---

### Enterprise Data (9% of global data)

**Generation:**
- Documents, communications, code, databases
- 13 zettabytes/year

**Utilization:**
- **Documents:** 41-80% never accessed after creation
- **Communications:** 85-91% never meaningfully consumed
- **Code:** 70-85% never reviewed after initial commit
- **Security logs:** 44% of alerts uninvestigated
- **Overall:** 70-75% never examined

**Sources:** NetApp 2024, Veritas Global Databerg Report, GitHub Octoverse, SANS
**Confidence:** High (90%+)

---

### Streaming Video (30% of global data)

**Generation:**
- Netflix, YouTube, TikTok, streaming services
- 45 zettabytes/year

**Utilization:**
- 60-70% watched (content created for consumption)
- Long-tail distribution: small fraction of content drives majority of views
- Catalog utilization varies by platform (proprietary data)

**Note:** "82% of internet traffic is video" (Cisco VNI) measures DATA TRANSMITTED (watched content), not DATA GENERATED (includes unwatched content)

## Study Limitations

1. **Temporal:** Data reflects 2024-2025 landscape
2. **Definitions:** "Examined" vs "analyzed" vs "acted upon" varies by source
3. **Data availability:** Proprietary systems don't publish statistics
4. **Category overlap:** Some double-counting potential (video ⊆ surveillance ⊆ IoT)
5. **Source reliability:** Some data from vendors (not independently audited)
