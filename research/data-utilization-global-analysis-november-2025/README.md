# Global Data Generation and Utilization Rates

**Research Study**
**Date:** November 9-10, 2025
**Researcher:** Daniel Miessler
**Research Design:** Multi-agent parallel investigation (9 specialized agents)

---

## Research Question

What percentage of data generated globally is actually viewed, analyzed, or acted upon by humans or AI systems?

---

## Methodology

### Research Design

Multi-agent parallel research utilizing 9 specialized AI research agents distributed across 4 platforms (Perplexity AI, Claude, Gemini, WebSearch) to gather and cross-validate data from industry reports, platform statistics, and academic studies.

**Research Duration:** 6 hours across 2 sessions
**Source Coverage:** 150+ authoritative sources (2024-2025 data)

### Agent Assignments

**Phase 1: Enterprise Data (6 agents)**
1. Enterprise dark data statistics (Veritas, IDC, Gartner)
2. Communication engagement rates (email, Slack, Teams)
3. Document access patterns (Google Docs, Word, Confluence)
4. Code review coverage (GitHub, GitLab)
5. Security log analysis rates (SIEM, observability tools)
6. AI automation penetration in enterprises

**Phase 2: Global Data Breakdown (3 agents)**
7. Global data generation by type (149 ZB total)
8. Video content utilization (streaming, surveillance, user-generated)
9. IoT sensor data utilization (21.1B devices)

### Quality Assurance

- Minimum 3 sources per major claim
- Cross-platform verification
- Confidence levels assigned to all findings
- Contradictory evidence documented

---

## Primary Finding

**Of 149 zettabytes generated globally in 2024:**
- **12-15% examined** by humans or AI (~20 ZB)
- **85-88% never examined** by anyone (~129 ZB)

**Breakdown by examiner:**
- Humans only: 8-10%
- AI only: 5-10%
- Both human and AI: ~3%
- Neither: 85-88%

## Study Limitations

1. **Temporal:** Data reflects 2024-2025 landscape
2. **Definitions:** "Examined" vs "analyzed" vs "acted upon" varies by source
3. **Data availability:** Proprietary systems don't publish statistics
4. **Category overlap:** Some double-counting potential (video ⊆ surveillance ⊆ IoT)
5. **Source reliability:** Some data from vendors (not independently audited)
