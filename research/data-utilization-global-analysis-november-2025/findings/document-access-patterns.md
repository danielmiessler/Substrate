# Document Creation vs Access Rates: Quantifying the Utilization Gap

**Research Date:** November 10, 2025
**Context:** Analysis of document creation (149 billion words/day globally) versus actual consumption rates
**Objective:** Quantify the gap between document CREATION and document CONSUMPTION

---

## Executive Summary

Research reveals a massive utilization gap between document creation and consumption:

- **41-80%** of stored documents are **never accessed** after creation
- **60-73%** of enterprise data goes **completely unused** for analytics or business purposes
- **55%** of organizational data remains **"dark data"** (created but never illuminated)
- **33%** of all content is **ROT data** (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial)

The document creation engine is massively overproducing relative to actual consumption, representing substantial waste in storage costs, employee time, and organizational efficiency.

### Single-Author Documents

**Inverse Calculation:**
- If **70%** collaborate weekly, **30%** may not (potential single-author population)
- Academic context: Multi-authored papers show higher quality and citation rates than single-authored
- Single-author documents likely have **lower access rates** and **higher abandonment risk**

### Sharing Statistics

**Private vs Shared Files:**
- No published Google/Microsoft statistics on private vs. shared file ratios
- Files are **private by default** until manually shared

## Analysis: The Massive Creation-Consumption Gap

### The Core Problem

**149 billion words created daily** (from original context) versus:
- **41-80% never accessed** = 61-119 billion words/day created but never consumed
- **60-73% unused for business** = 89-109 billion words/day providing zero organizational value
- **55% dark data** = 82 billion words/day disappearing into darkness

### Structural Causes

1. **Creation Friction < Consumption Friction**
   - Easy to create documents (2 billion/month in Google Workspace alone)
   - Hard to find documents (30% of workday spent searching)
   - Result: Overproduction relative to discoverability

2. **Private by Default Architecture**
   - Files private until manually shared
   - 30% of users don't collaborate weekly
   - Single-author documents have lower utility

3. **Lack of Knowledge Management Strategy**
   - Only 31% have comprehensive strategy
   - 25% of documents lost without ECM
   - Orphaned pages with no incoming links

4. **Short Active Lifecycle**
   - 30-90 days before data becomes "less useful"
   - Flood of new data buries existing content
   - 99% duplication in backup versions

### Business Impact

**Wasted Resources:**
- Storage costs for 41-80% never-accessed files
- Employee time: 50% spent creating/preparing documents (25% end up lost)
- Search inefficiency: 2.5 hours/day seeking information

**ROI Opportunity:**
- **404%** ROI with proper DMS implementation
- **98 hours/month** saved per organization
- **30-40%** operational cost reduction
- **$20,000** annual savings from process optimization

## Conclusion

The document creation-consumption gap is substantial and quantifiable:

- **At least 41%** of documents are never accessed after creation (conservative)
- **Up to 80%** in poorly managed environments (high-end estimate)
- **60-73%** of enterprise data provides **zero business value**
- **55%** remains "dark" despite creation investment

**The utilization gap represents massive inefficiency:** Organizations are creating 149 billion words/day globally, but 61-119 billion words/day (41-80%) disappear into the void, consuming storage, employee time, and organizational focus while providing no return on investment.

**The opportunity:** Proper document management systems deliver 404% ROI by addressing this gap—not by creating more documents, but by making existing documents findable, usable, and valuable.

The problem isn't document creation capability. **The problem is document consumption infrastructure.**
