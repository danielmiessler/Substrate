| **General Data Analysis** | 10-20% | 60-70% | 10-20% | Capacity limited |

### Aggregate Enterprise Data Processing

**Weighted Average Calculation:**

Assuming enterprise data distribution:
- 30% customer interactions → 80% AI = 24%
- 20% operational/transactional → 35% AI = 7%
- 15% security events → 40% AI = 6%
- 20% documents → 18% AI = 3.6%
- 15% analytics/BI → 20% AI = 3%

**Total: Approximately 43.6% of enterprise data touched by AI**

However, "touched by AI" ≠ "meaningfully processed by AI"

**Meaningful Processing Estimate:**
- Considering failed projects (70-85% failure rate)
- Considering pilot vs. production gap (69% stuck in pilot)
- Considering actual usage vs. deployment (many tools unused)

**Adjusted Estimate: 15-25% of enterprise data is meaningfully processed by AI systems**

### Ratio Breakdowns by Industry

**High AI-Processing Industries:**
- **Technology/SaaS:** 35-45% (GitHub Copilot 90%, customer support 85%)
- **Financial Services:** 25-35% (fraud detection, risk analysis)
- **E-commerce/Retail:** 30-40% (recommendations, customer support)

**Medium AI-Processing Industries:**
- **Healthcare:** 15-25% (imaging, diagnostics, but heavy regulation)
- **Manufacturing:** 20-30% (quality control, predictive maintenance)
- **Telecommunications:** 25-35% (network optimization, support)

**Low AI-Processing Industries:**
- **Government:** 5-15% (regulatory constraints, legacy systems)
- **Education:** 10-20% (limited budgets, resistance)
- **Legal:** 10-20% (privacy concerns, professional standards)

### The Human-AI Collaboration Model

**Current Reality:**
- **Pure AI (No Human Review):** 15-20% of decisions
- **AI-Assisted Human Decision:** 30-40% of decisions
- **Human-Only (No AI):** 40-55% of decisions

**Projected 2028:**
- **Pure AI:** 30-40%
- **AI-Assisted Human:** 50-60%
- **Human-Only:** 10-20%

**Key Insight:** The narrative of "AI replacing humans" is misleading. The actual pattern is **AI augmentation**, where AI processes data first, but humans make final decisions in 60-75% of cases. Pure AI automation exists primarily in high-volume, low-stakes decisions (customer support FAQs, code completion, alert triage).

   - Current 3% of workforce insufficient
   - Need 5-7% to meet AI deployment goals

4. **Target High-Value, Low-Risk Use Cases**
   - Customer support: proven 75-85% automation
   - Code generation: 41% with high ROI
   - Document processing: 78% adoption, need better implementation
   - Avoid high-stakes decisions until explainability improves

### For Realistic Planning

1. **Plan for 20-30% AI Coverage by 2028**
   - Not 80-90% despite vendor claims
   - Realistic given current 7-8 percentage point annual growth
   - Acceleration requires addressing organizational barriers

2. **Expect Hybrid Human-AI Models**
   - Pure AI automation limited to 15-20% of decisions
   - 30-40% AI-assisted is more realistic target
   - 40-55% will remain human-only for foreseeable future

3. **Budget for Failure and Iteration**
   - 70-85% failure rate is current reality
   - Plan for 3-5 attempts per successful deployment
   - Expect 2-3 year timeline for production deployment

## 10. Data Sources & Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (Multiple Sources, Consistent Data)

✅ **78% enterprise AI adoption** (McKinsey, IBM, ISG Research)
✅ **75-85% customer support AI coverage** (Zendesk, ServiceNow, ada, Tidio)
✅ **41% AI-generated code** (GitHub, GitClear, Stack Overflow)
✅ **70-85% AI project failure rate** (RAND, IDC, Gartner, MIT)
✅ **53% RPA adoption** (Deloitte, UiPath)
✅ **90% Fortune 100 use GitHub Copilot** (GitHub, Second Talent)

### Medium Confidence (Single Source or Extrapolated)

⚠️ **15-25% overall data processing estimate** (Extrapolated from category data)
⚠️ **82% unstructured data unprocessed** (SER Group, Grand View Research)
⚠️ **96% data teams at/over capacity** (Ascend.io survey)
⚠️ **31% production deployment rate** (ISG Report 2025)

### Low Confidence (Vendor Claims or Projections)

⚡ **95% of customer interactions by 2025** (Zendesk CEO claim)
⚡ **60% of SOC workloads AI-handled in 3 years** (Industry projection)
⚡ **85% implementing AI agents by end 2025** (Aggressive timeline)

### Data Gaps Identified

❌ **No direct statistics** on percentage of enterprise data analyzed by AI vs. humans
❌ **Limited industry-specific** breakdowns for most categories
❌ **Few longitudinal studies** tracking same organizations over time
❌ **Unclear definitions** of "using AI" across surveys (pilot vs. production)

## Conclusion

**The Bottom Line:** Approximately **15-25% of enterprise data is currently being processed by AI systems**, with significant variation by use case (5% to 85%). This is far below both AI's theoretical potential (45-70% of tasks could be automated) and organizational adoption rates (78% have deployed AI). The primary barriers are not technological but organizational: 70-85% project failure rates, 82% of unstructured data remaining unprocessed, 96% of data teams at capacity, and only 3% of workforce in data roles.

The bigger story isn't AI vs. human analysis — it's that **60-75% of enterprise data is never analyzed by anyone**. AI's true opportunity is not replacing human analysis but unlocking this massive "dark data" reservoir. However, realizing this potential requires solving fundamental organizational challenges around data quality, skills, infrastructure, and change management that currently cause 7 out of 8 AI projects to fail before reaching production.
