## Percentage of Generated Data Never Viewed/Analyzed

| Data Type | % Never Viewed | % of Global Data | Key Finding | Source |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Surveillance Video** | 95-99% | 22% | 1+ billion cameras worldwide; footage stored for compliance, only reviewed if incident reported | Grand View Research 2024; Security industry estimates |
| **IoT Sensor Data** | 95%+ | 23% | 21.1 billion devices; 90% becomes "dark data"; 99% lost before reaching decision-makers in industrial settings | IoT Analytics 2024; McKinsey Digital |
| **Machine Logs & Telemetry** | 80-90% | 14% | Stored for compliance, not analysis; >90% of observability data never read | Coralogix 2024; SANS SOC Survey 2024 |
| **Enterprise Data** | 70-75% | 9% | Documents: 41-80% never accessed after creation; Communications: 85-91% never meaningfully consumed | NetApp 2024; Veritas Global Databerg Report 2016; Forrester |
| **User-Generated Video** | 60-80% | ~15% | YouTube: 91% of videos <1,000 views; Twitch: 80-90% of streams have zero viewers | YouTube statistics 2024; TwitchTracker |
| **Social Media (non-video)** | 60-70% | 2% | Facebook video: 0.08% engagement; Most content brief visibility then forgotten | Social media engagement studies 2024 |
| **Streaming Video** | 30-40% | 30% | Created for consumption; long-tail effect (small fraction of catalog drives majority of views) | Cisco VNI 2024; Streaming service analytics |
| **GLOBAL TOTAL** | **85-88%** | **100%** | **Of 149 zettabytes generated annually, ~129 ZB never examined** | **Weighted calculation across categories** |

## Key Statistics Summary

- **Total data generated globally (2024):** 149 zettabytes/year
- **Data examined by humans or AI:** 12-15% (~20 zettabytes)
- **Data never examined:** 85-88% (~129 zettabytes)
- **Human examination only:** 8-10%
- **AI examination only:** 5-10%
- **Both human and AI:** ~3%

## The Biggest Offenders

1. **Surveillance cameras:** 5.5 million TB/day of footage, 99% unwatched
2. **IoT sensors:** 79.4 ZB/year generated, edge filtering discards 30-50% immediately, <5% of remainder analyzed
3. **Enterprise dark data:** 52-85% collected but never analyzed (Veritas, IDC)
4. **YouTube long tail:** 91% of videos receive <1,000 views; 5% have exactly zero views
5. **Live streaming:** 95% of Twitch streamers never grow beyond zero viewership
